Description
Documentation of a recent security incident
Two phases
Detection and Analysis: This scenario is showing the org detecting a ransomware attack. For this first step, technical assistance was sought out by other organizations
Containment, Eradication, and Recovery: This step shows the process of the org to contain the incident.
Tool(s) used
None
The 5 W's 
Capture the 5 W's of an incident.
Who: Hackers who targeted employees with phishing emails to gain network access and deploy malicious software.
What: A group of unethical hackers used the network to target employees with phishing emails, which deployed malicious software and allowed them to encrypt medical files, holding them for ransom.
When: This occurred on 1/20/2024 at 9am
Where: The incident happened at the health care clinic and over the systems network specifically.
Why: The incident happened because an employee(s) fell for the phishing email that gave up access to our files. Their motivations are financial gain, with them leaving a ransom note demanding money for a decryption key.
Additional notes
Further protection against these emails and education about them should be implemented. Should the ransom be paid?

Description
A fake resume was sent to HR that was password protected. Once the password was inserted it was meant to activate a malicious file. 
Tool(s) used
Phishing email
The 5 W's 
Capture the 5 W's of an incident.
Who caused the incident? Clyde West, sent using the email of Def Communications
What happened? There was an email sent claiming to contain a resume, but it was really a malicious file that was needing a password input to be executed
When did the incident occur? July 20th, 2022 at 9:30am 
Where did the incident happen? This took place in an email targeting the financial services company
Why did the incident happen? Because the attacker was wanting to deploy malicious files for an unknown reason at the moment. Could be for access to sensitive info, to try to hold systems for ransom, etc.
Additional notes
Given that we know the hash was for a malicious file, we can say that it is indeed malicious. On top of that, the resume needed to be unlocked by a password, which could be true but that is something commonly used to execute malicious files as well.

Description
Analyzing a packet capture file
Tool(s) used
For this activity I used Wireshark. This is a network protocol analyzer that uses GUI. Wireshark allows analysts to capture and analyze network traffic, which helps in terms of detecting malicious activity.
The 5 W's 
Capture the 5 W's of an incident.
Who: N/A
What: N/A
When: N/A
Where: N/A
Why: N/A
Additional notes
This was my first time using Wireshark so it was very interesting. I am looking forward to using this tool more to understand and analyze network traffic.

Reflections/Notes: All of them were a bit challenging because I am new to the field and having to use them. Mainly when writing about the tools used I was confused. I would say my understanding of incident response has changed during the course but I still have so much to learn. This just taught the basics and sometimes would explain things without showing a visual representation so knowing what to look for was difficult at times. I liked using Chronicle the most out of the tools we used. It was pretty easy to understand and read while also providing a lot of information.
